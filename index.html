                <h2 class="p2">Founder @ <a href="https://example.com/mettle-films" target="_blank">Mettle Films</a></h2>
                <p>Sangita Iyer is a passionate storyteller, filmmaker, and educator who has dedicated her life to making a meaningful impact through her work. Born and raised with deep cultural roots, she now calls Canada home, where she continues to create thought-provoking documentaries that spark change. As the founder of Mettle Films, Sangita brings to life stories that are simple yet profoundly insightful, always carrying a message of social relevance.</p>
                <p>With a Master’s degree in Psychology and certifications in Positive Psychology and Adult Education, Sangita’s career began in the corporate world as a Learning and Development expert. But her heart always beat for storytelling, and she found her true calling behind the camera. Her debut film, <em>GuruCool</em>, an exploration of the evolving Indian education system, has been showcased at over 30 international film festivals across the globe, winning accolades for its powerful narrative.</p>
                <p>What makes Sangita’s work stand out is her ability to weave together her passions—education, mental health, and environmental sustainability—into stories that resonate with people everywhere. Whether it’s advocating for mental well-being, addressing the disconnection between humans and nature, or celebrating ancient wisdom, her films have a way of touching hearts and minds.</p>
                <p>Sangita’s love for animals led her to co-create a children’s book with her daughter, who illustrated it at just 10 years old. The book was written in memory of their beloved rescue dog, Simba, and all proceeds go toward supporting animal rescue efforts in India and Canada—a testament to her generous and compassionate spirit.</p>
                <p>Her filmmaking journey hasn’t been without challenges. Financing meaningful cinema that stays true to her vision has often been an uphill battle. But Sangita’s determination and the unwavering support of her family, especially her husband and children, have been her anchors. “Without their encouragement, I wouldn’t be able to do what I love,” she often says.</p>
                <p>Through her upcoming projects, <em>Mulam</em> and <em>Mitti</em>, Sangita continues her mission of exploring stories that matter. <em>Mulam</em> delves into the ancient Gurukul system, blending modern education with timeless wisdom, while <em>Mitti</em> shines a light on the inspiring life of a local farmer in Canada. Both films reflect her commitment to amplifying voices and narratives that often go unheard.</p>
                <p>When she’s not behind the camera, Sangita can be found cheering at a sports game, savoring a perfectly brewed cup of chai, or volunteering for causes close to her heart. A firm believer in gratitude and giving back, she’s not just a filmmaker but a changemaker who uses her art to inspire and empower.</p>
                <p>Sangita’s journey is a reminder that when passion meets purpose, the possibilities are endless. And while the road may not always be easy, her work stands as a testament to the power of perseverance, storytelling, and the belief that even a small film can make a big difference.</p>
